:: v1.2
:: Changed comments around project name and removed ""
:: Changed ECHO in check for drl. and .NPTH file.
:: Changed output filename

:: V1.0
:: Initial Release

:: Convert_to_pdf.bat
:: This script uses Gerber2pdf to convert multiple gerber files from kicad into one pdf. Useful for etching
:: It checks for a bottom layer and for a top layer
:: It also checks for a drill file (Excellon) and a NPTH file (non plated through hole).
:: Colours and mirroring can be adjusted in Line 57 and 58 but it should work as it is.
